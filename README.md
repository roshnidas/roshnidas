## ðŸš€ **About Me**

I'm a Software Engineer with a few years of diving deep into building scalable, high-performing tech solutions. My toolkit's pretty solid with Java, Spring, Spring Boot, and AWS, and I really enjoy crafting resilient, distributed systems that help us deliver efficient products and ensure everything hums along perfectly.
I thrive on turning tough problems into elegant system designs that support complex workflows, integrate beautifully with our existing tools, and scale up to handle any demand.
